# backup
An rsync backup script written in bash.										<br>
Backs up to a removable sata drive.										<br>
Backs up everything not listed in exclude option.								<br>
Creates "date.backup" log file, placed on users desktop.							<br>
Backup is set up as a fallback bootable os via fstab edits and adding entry to existing boot loader.		<br>
I have the script set up on a timer for weekly, automated full system backups.					<br>															<br>
