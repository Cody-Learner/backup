# backup
An rsync backup script written in bash. <br>
Backs up to a removable sata drive. <br>
Backs up everything not listed in exclude option. <br>
Creates "date.backup" log file, placed on users desktop. <br>
<br>
I have the script set up on a timer for automated, weekly, full system backups and backup is set up as a fallback bootable os via editing fstab and adding entry to existing boot loader. <br>
